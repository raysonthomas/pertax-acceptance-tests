As a user
I need to know that the service I am using is in beta and have a way to feed back on it
So that my expectations are managed and I can help improve the service

JIRA - MTA497

Given 'Jim Ferguson' is logged in to PTA
And page address path is '/pertax'
Or '/profile'
Then Beta heading is: 'BETA This is a new service - your feedback will help us to improve it.'
And the feedback link leads to: '/somewhere'
